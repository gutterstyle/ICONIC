## How to use

After installation and activation, you should go in settings (`File` → `Preferences` → `File Icon Theme` on Windows, or `Code` → `Preferences`  → `File Icon Theme` on macOS), and select `ICONIC`.

## Want more?

I can add more icons, [open a **new** issue](https://github.com/gutterstyle/ICONIC/issues) and ask for the icons you want to be added.
